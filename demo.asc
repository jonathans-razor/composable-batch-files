:My first thought was to have a routed application.

:I couldn't find a good Cesium map tutorial, so I used Leaflet.

:+ I spent a day or 2 frustrated trying to get shadcn to work but kept having issues.

::Then I realized there is a separate webiste specifically for Vue with Shadcn.

::https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation

::versus

::https://shadcn-vue.com/docs/installation.html

:I was having an issue getting the TailwindCss styling to work with the shadcn samples.

:I really wanted to learn how to use Shadcn and Aceternity.

::Aceternity requires you to use React, Tailwind and Framer motion.

:I spent a few hours on the integration issues but didn't want to get stuck there so I 
moved on. I reached out to Reetesh but we couldn't figure it out.

:I realized later, after speaking with Tenzin, that I should've used the Quasar router instead 
of the one that I used.

:Some shadcn controls are cool but so are the Quasar controls.

:Tailwind blew away my styling.
