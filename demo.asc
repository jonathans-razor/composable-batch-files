;Demo (!demo)

:Notice that there is there is no dialog component code before I run the CLI command.

:I was having an issue getting the TailwindCss styling to work with the shadcn samples.

::Then I realized there is a separate webiste specifically for Vue with Shadcn.

:I really wanted to learn how to use Shadcn and Aceternity.

:I spent a few hours on the integration issues but didn't want to get stuck there so I 
moved on. I reached out to Reetesh but we couldn't figure it out.

:I realized later, after speaking with Tenzin, that I should've used the Quasar router instead 
of the one that I used.

:Tailwind blew away my styling.
