:How is my sound quality?

:+ Chae, Manoj and Tsedalu asked me to let them know some of the things I was doing to learn 
Vue. This presentation is my attempt to show that.

:Since I began this project, I have been tracking a lot of my Vue learning on my GitHub 
website here:

::https://github.com/jonathans-razor/vue-testing

::I have summarized this on the spreadsheet here:

::https://raw.githack.com/jonathans-razor/vue-testing/main/learn-vue.html

::(!qq)

:Go down the list.

:A few different working versions of hello world.

:The folders in the folders columns correspond to the folders in the repository.

:It's one thing to simply watch a tutorial and it's another to get things working on your 
local drive. It gives you more confidence if you are able to get the code working locally. So 
that's what I like to do. Get things to work locally.

::If you download the repository, all the apps should work. You would just need to run npm 
install and then start the server on the correct port.

::I have tested and successfully ran 26 projects on my local.

:Tutorial and example code was very helpful. 15 tutorials and 26 examples.

:All the top section spreadsheet items are runnable.

:Expense tracker was one of the better tutorials.

:Tyler Potts, also a good one.

:Vue Examples, looked very interesting. Once I finish looking at the Vue doucmentation, if I 
have time, I want look at some of these examples. So many cool examples.
