:My goal is to learn as much as possible and build working apps but not necessarily a useful 
app.

:+ My first thought was to have a routed application with multiple pages.

::1.

::rzr rn fg

:I spent a few hours on the integration issues but didn't want to get stuck there so I 
moved on. I reached out to Reetesh but we couldn't figure it out. I didn't want to get stuck.

:I couldn't find a good Cesium map tutorial, so I used Leaflet.

::rzr rn dapi

:5. One of the first Quasar apps I worked on was this one.

::rzr rn qv

:+ I spent a day or 2 frustrated trying to get shadcn to work but kept having issues.

::I was having an issue getting the TailwindCss styling to work with the shadcn samples.

::Tailwind blew away my styling.

::Then I realized there is a separate webiste specifically for Vue with Shadcn.

::rzr sf shad

:+ I really wanted to learn how to use Shadcn and Aceternity.

::7.

::rzr sf gg

::Aceternity requires you to use React, Tailwind and Framer Motion.

:8.

::rzr rn qt

:Some shadcn controls are cool but so are the Quasar controls. Just more options I guess. 
Quasar has some great controls.
