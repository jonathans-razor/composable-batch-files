;Demo (!demo)

:I didn't want to spend a lot of time on the integration issues. I reached out to Reetesh but 
we couldn't figure it out.

:I realized later, after speaking with Tenzin, that I should've used the Quasar router instead 
of the one that I used.

:Tailwind blew away my styling.

:I really wanted to learn how to use Shadcn and Aceternity.
