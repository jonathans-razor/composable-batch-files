:Aug-29-2023: A framework should be built in a recallable way. That is, the location of things 
should be in a logical or recallable fashion so that when to trying recall things, things are 
where you expect them to be.

:Aug-28-2023: discreet batch files should not be mixed with composable batch files.

:Apr-28-2023: Assumption: batch file labels are unique and do not contain periods.

:Nov-17-2022: Unlike when you call n [blank], when you call pn [blank], you are expecting 
that folder to exist. So don't use "call pn [blank]>nul" because you want to know when that 
folder is not there.

:CBF error messages should be accurate.

:Calls to ivgn should be made before other iv calls.

:On one hand I definitely want to see error messages. On the other I don't want to see a lot 
of extraneous information.

:When I used "call pn" in an "iv" rubric, I ran into problems. Sep-1-2021

:You must put any call statements BEFORE cbf-pd is set. Otherwise it could get overwritten.

:cbf-pd should NEVER be set in an "iv" rubric.

:When passing in parameters, aliases should precede DCVs.

:I kept the facade dictionaries because they help make clear the author's intent when calling 
which variable is being set.
